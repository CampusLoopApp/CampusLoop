- **Story:** This app makes it easier to navigate campus and allows for easier communication and stronger connections amongst students
- **Market:** Any college campus could use this app. Students from that college would use the app to connect.
- **Habit:** Students can check the app daily for upcoming events and also make extra money by selling furniture/products/etc.
